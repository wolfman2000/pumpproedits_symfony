This is the repository for Pump Pro Edits V3: Player Power.
It is called as such because the players can now directly
contribute to how the website looks, feels, and behaves.

There will be minor configuration required to play around
with this on your own computers. Those that have used
Symfony before will realize that config/databases.yml
is NOT included. This is done for security reasons.
If you want to play around with the database, please
set up your own local copy.

In the root of this project, remember to create the
cache and log folders. Give 777 permissions to
both of them.

The schema will be set up in the near future. Please
be patient.

As far as coding standards go, keep it legible. Using
unicode/utf-8 is alright if it's for a decent reason.
Tabs versus spaces, where braces go, etc, is not something
I care deeply about.

Try to use git's branching functionality when adding
new features. The master branch should really only contain
code that is guaranteed to run.

If there are any questions, feel free to contact me.
