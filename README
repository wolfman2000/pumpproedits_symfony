This is the repository for Pump Pro Edits V3: Player Power.
It is called as such because the players can now directly
contribute to how the website looks, feels, and behaves.

There will be minor configuration required to play around
with this on your own computers.

1) This project uses the Doctrine ORM plugin. If you
are used to Propel, the switch shouldn't be that bad.

2) Those that have used Symfony before will realize that
config/databases.yml is NOT included. This is done for
security reasons. If you want to play around with the
database, please set up your own local copy. Likewise,
you will have to generate the SQL through doctrine:build-sql.

3) In the root of this project, remember to create the
cache and log folders. Give 777 permissions to
both of them.

As far as coding standards go, keep it legible. Using
unicode/utf-8 is alright if it's for a decent reason.
Tabs versus spaces, where braces go, etc, is not something
I care deeply about. The only exception to that rule is
when dealing with the YAML files (yml). Those cannot have
tabs for any reason.

Try to use git's branching functionality when adding
new features. The master branch should really only contain
code that is guaranteed to run.

If there are any questions, feel free to contact me.
