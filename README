This is the repository for Pump Pro Edits V3: Player Power.
It is called as such because the players can now directly
contribute to how the website looks, feels, and behaves.

There will be minor configuration required to play around
with this on your own computers. Those that have used
Symfony before will realize that config/databases.yml
is NOT included. This is done for security reasons.
If you want to play around with the database, please
set up your own local copy.

As far as coding standards go, keep it legible.
