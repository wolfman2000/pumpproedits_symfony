<h2>Base Edit Files</h2> 
<p>
	Edit files are made with a .edit extension, and placed in
	the appropriate folder on your USB drive when you go play
	Pump It Up Pro.
</p>
<p>
	At times you may want to edit a song's steps, but don't
	exactly know what measure they start on or how long
	the song lasts.  The base edit files below are
	provided as a convenience for edit makers to have
	a place to start.
</p>
<p>
	These are so useful, even some of
	the developers of the game use these files.  Surely
	they will work for you!  Just download the single
	and/or double steps of the files you want.
