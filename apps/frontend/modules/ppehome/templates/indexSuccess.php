<p>
Welcome to the new home of the <abbr title="In The Groove">ITG</abbr>
edit database. There is no question within the music game community
that ITG is still a popular and important game within our history.
This page serves to recognize its contributions to the edit data
that many users created on the former ITGFreak.</p>
<p>
Note that unlike its <a href="http://www.pumpproedits.com">Pump Pro cousin</a>,
there is no membership functionality at this time. This page is primarily
to view the charts of both what the authors and users made. The
base edits are provided in case you want to try your hand at it, but
for now, individual edits will have to be <a href="mailto:jafelds@gmail.com">emailed
in</a> to be included.
</p>
<p>With this in mind, have a look around and witness history!</p>
