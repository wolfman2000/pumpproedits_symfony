<?php slot('title', "Upload an Edit â€” Pump Pro Edits");
slot('h2', "<h2>Upload an Edit</h2>"); ?>

<p>
  Uploading an edit is relatively simple. Just select
  the file and say who owns the chart. Please only upload
  charts that either you made or Andamiro created.
</p>
<p>
  This same form is used for uploading new and updated edits.
  As a general rule, you cannot have two edits of the same
  song and style (single or double) have the same edit title,
  even if the step content is different. If you do this, the old
  edit will be lost forever.
